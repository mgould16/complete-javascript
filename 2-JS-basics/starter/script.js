// /*
// Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!

// This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants.
// The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.
// // John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is
// between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.

// Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:
// 1. Create an object with an array for the bill values
// 2. Add a method to calculate the tip
// 3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations
// 4. As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and 2) an array containing final paid amounts
// (bill + tip). HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.


// EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45.
// Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).

// 5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules
// 6. Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips. HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average)
// 7. Calculate the average tip for each family
// 8. Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average
